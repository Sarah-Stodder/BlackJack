# BlackJack Game

## Description
This is my blackjack game project I made for coding temple's week 3 weekend project.
I had originally planned on using tkinter to run this project on a GUI, I did follow a code along and got a project I wasnt really happy with as I felt like it was just a copy of the original tkinter project.(carddeck.py)
Because I wasnt too hapy with it, I decided to create a command line game instead (project.py) and I utilized ascii_magic to liven up the game.



### Executing program
To run this program you need to downlaod all of the requirements, which can be found in the requirments.txt document.
From there it's pretty straight forward.
